# 🐍 Python DSA Roadmap

This repository is for tracking my progress as I learn **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Python**.

- 📅 Plan: 6 months
- 🚀 Goal: Build strong Python DSA skills from basics to advanced, with hands-on coding and problem solving.

I’ll be adding Python code examples, problem solutions, and notes as I go.
